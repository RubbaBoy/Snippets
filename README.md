# Overview

This repository contains code snippets which others may benefit from.
This isn't a library: the snippets are written in all kinds languages,
the documentation is minimal and the code will probably not work if you just copy-paste it.
Don't expect the code to be generalised either: it might be limited to a specific scenario
in its current form, you are supposed to edit it to make it fit your needs.
